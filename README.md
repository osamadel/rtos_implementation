# Real Time Operating System Implementation

This is my implementation of a simple real-time operating system that has the following interfaces:

- OS_init
- OS_createTask
- OS_deleteTask
- OS_suspend
- OS_resume
- OS_start

This OS was used to make different peripherals work concurrently including a buzzer, an LED, Servo motor and LCD
